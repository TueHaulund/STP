Sequence Transformation Pipeline

The unit tests were written using Boost.Test, so Boost is required to run the tests. The library itself does not use Boost.
The scons setup will compile the unit tests with either g++ or MinGW. The library has not been tested with other compilers, but any decently compliant C++11 compiler should work.
